# High Issues

## H-1: Uninitialized State Variables

Solidity does initialize variables by default when you declare them, however it's good practice to explicitly declare an initial value. For example, if you transfer money to an address we must make sure that the address has been initialized.

# Low Issues

## L-1: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

<details><summary>8 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/LevelOne.sol [Line: 120](src/LevelOne.sol#L120)

	```solidity
	    function initialize(address _principal, uint256 _schoolFees, address _usdcAddress) public initializer {
	```

- Found in src/LevelOne.sol [Line: 201](src/LevelOne.sol#L201)

	```solidity
	    function addTeacher(address _teacher) public onlyPrincipal notYetInSession {
	```

- Found in src/LevelOne.sol [Line: 220](src/LevelOne.sol#L220)

	```solidity
	    function removeTeacher(address _teacher) public onlyPrincipal {
	```

	```solidity
	    function expel(address _student) public onlyPrincipal {
	```

	```

	```solidity
	    function giveReview(address _student, bool review) public onlyTeacher {
	```

- Found in src/LevelOne.sol [Line: 295](src/LevelOne.sol#L295)

	```solidity

	```

- Found in src/LevelTwo.sol [Line: 28](src/LevelTwo.sol#L28)

	```solidity
	    function graduate() public reinitializer(2) {}
	```

</details>



## L-2: Empty `require()` / `revert()` statements

Use descriptive reason strings or custom errors for revert paths.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/LevelOne.sol [Line: 245](src/LevelOne.sol#L245)

	```solidity
	            revert();
	```

</details>



## L-3: Modifiers invoked only once can be shoe-horned into the function



<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/LevelOne.sol [Line: 101](src/LevelOne.sol#L101)

	```solidity
	    modifier onlyTeacher() {
	```

</details>



## L-4: Empty Block

Consider removing empty blocks.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/LevelOne.sol [Line: 314](src/LevelOne.sol#L314)

	```solidity
	    function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override onlyPrincipal {}
	```

- Found in src/LevelTwo.sol [Line: 28](src/LevelTwo.sol#L28)

	```solidity
	    function graduate() public reinitializer(2) {}
	```

</details>



## L-5: Unused Custom Error

it is recommended that the definition be removed when custom error is unused

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/LevelOne.sol [Line: 86](src/LevelOne.sol#L86)

	```solidity
	    error HH__HawkHighFeesNotPaid();
	```

</details>



## L-6: Boolean equality is not required.

If `x` is a boolean, there is no need to do `if(x == true)` or `if(x == false)`. Just use `if(x)` and `if(!x)` respectively.
